# CodeClan Cars :blue_car: :oncoming_automobile: 

### Model a car dealership, making sure to use the concepts that we've covered in Java so far as appropriate.

### You should be working in a TDD fashion and creating tests for each of your classes. :white_check_mark: :x: 

#### Make sure you plan effectively in preparation for the extensions if you have enough time to attempt them. :alarm_clock: 

# MVP (which includes Tests)
* Plan out the classes and draw a class diagram.
* Create classes for different components (e.g. engine, tyres) that can be used to compose a vehicle, you can add as many as you like.
* Create different vehicle types (e.g. Car, Electric Car, Hybrid Car, etc)
* Assign them various properties (e.g. price, colour, engine etc.)
* Create classes for Customer and Dealership.
* Customers will have money and a collection of owned vehicles.
* Dealership will have stock of different types of cars and a till. 

Think about what tools you already have and make a decision on what is the best to use for the task.

# Extension
* Allow a customer to buy a vehicle.
* Allow dealership to buy vehicles
* Allow Dealerships to sell vehicles to customers.
* Allow damage to be added to a vehicle. This should be a cost and be removed from vehicles price.
* Allow dealership to repair vehicles. This should take the cost from the dealer and add back to value of vehicle.


#### You are required to do Git Commits, feel free to practice branching if you would like. I would expect a **minimum** of 20 commits.
